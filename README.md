# **Sri Sai Dhanush**

Backend developer with strong experience in Python and Django ecosystems. I like building things fast, iterating, documenting systems clearly, and experimenting with automation. Most of my projects focus on backend engineering, structured APIs, and practical systems that solve real problems.
